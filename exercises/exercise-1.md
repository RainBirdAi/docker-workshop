# Exercise 1
 
In this exercise we'll be running through the official Docker tutorial to get a 
taster for using Docker. We'll cover each of the the concepts involved in more 
detail in future exercises.
 
# An Introduction to Docker

1. Run through the Docker tutorial located at: [https://www.docker.com/tryit/]()

   > **Tip:** The tutorials are case sensitive and quite dumb in what they're 
   > looking for. If you're having problems check your input matches the 
   > expected text.

   > **Note:** You _don't_ need to do the follow on steps once you've completed the 
   > 8 tutorials, although you may want to revisit them later if you want to do
   > more investigation on your own.
